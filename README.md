# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent for Parameter Optimisation

This project implements a simple linear regression model with gradient descent in Python from scratch. It's very useful for understanding how these concepts work fundamentally.

##Features
 - Customisable learning rate and iterations
 - User inputs for specific prediction requests
 - Visualisation of the cost function during gradient descent and the regression line

 ##Licence
This project is licenced under the MIT licence --> see the licence file for details
